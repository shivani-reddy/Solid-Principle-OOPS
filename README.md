# solid principle 
SOLID principles are object-oriented design concepts relevant to software development. SOLID is an acronym for five other class-design principles: **Single Responsibility Principle, Open-Closed Principle, Liskov Substitution Principle, Interface Segregation Principle, and Dependency Inversion Principle.**

Principle

Description

**Single Responsibility Principle**

Each class should be responsible for a single part or functionality of the system

**Open-Closed Principle**

Software components should be open for extension, but not for modification.

**Liskov Substitution Principle**

Objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of its subclasses without breaking the system.

**Interface Segregation Principle**

No client should be forced to depend on methods that it does not use.

**Dependency Inversion Principle**

High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules, both should depend on abstractions.
